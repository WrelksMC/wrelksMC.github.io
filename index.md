## 12/14/2021 Update
* Given that every player at this point pretty much has every item, I thought it would be 
appropriate to take a page out of the SciCraft server's rule book and enable duping. This will
allow a massive upscaling in the creation of major builds and contraptions. We all have max enchanted stuff
made of diamond / netherite so duping for valuables is obviously not a temptation any more. So enjoy, building what
ever your mind can come up with. 
* The dupe that I've chosen to *'un-patch'* on the server is the craft-dupe. You may've heard of it if you ever played on an
anarchy server. [Here is how to use the dupe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbnGgqtiDz0)
* Funny that it's a little kid tho lmao, it's literally the only good tutorial on this, ha.
* Carpet/Rail slimeblock dupe enabled.
